After some trial and error, we realized the issue was related to the Ultimaker Cura slicing software configuration. </p> <p>Sovol provides a version of the Cura software but is five versions back and only for Windows users. For the rest of us, I guess the thought is that we need to figure it out. That\u2019s a bit frustrating. Luckily after multiple trials and bad prints, I came across a post on Reddit that showed how to add the SV06-Plus profile to the latest Ultimaker Cura slicing software. So far I\u2019ve had success. To make sure others find this information I\u2019ve written a graphical version of the original directions. If you are tech-savvy, take a look at the original it\u2019s quite easy.</p> <p>Tutorial</p> <p>This tutorial is broken up into two parts. First, for absolute beginners, it goes through the installation process.

However, while I could automate the processes on the backend using either nodejs or python it dawned on me that if I were to get sick, no one else on the team would be able to resolve the issues. This could be thought of as Job Security but personally that comes off a bit devious to me, so... I took the time to learn it.</p> <p>I've written a small tutorial that covers how to produce a simulated HTTP/REST style environment. Is the best solution? Far from it, but if you're like me and your company is comfortable with using then here is an option for you.</p> <p>Recently</p> <p>After writing this article I came across the Microsoft365 REST feature. I've yet to try it out but it looks like it might be a similiar integration to the tutorial below.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/05/30/mastering-http-requests-with-microsoft-power-automate/#tools-youll-need","title":"Tools you'll need","text":"Logo Service / Application Microsoft Power AutomateThe primary platform for building our HTTP requests.
