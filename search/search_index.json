After some trial and error, we realized the issue was related to the Ultimaker Cura slicing software configuration. </p> <p>Sovol provides a version of the Cura software but is five versions back and only for Windows users. For the rest of us, I guess the thought is that we need to figure it out. That\u2019s a bit frustrating. Luckily after multiple trials and bad prints, I came across a post on Reddit that showed how to add the SV06-Plus profile to the latest Ultimaker Cura slicing software. So far I\u2019ve had success. To make sure others find this information I\u2019ve written a graphical version of the original directions.
