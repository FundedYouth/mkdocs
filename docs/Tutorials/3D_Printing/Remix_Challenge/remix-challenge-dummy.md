# Dummy Remix Challenge

??? info "About Remix Challenges"
    Welcome the Remix Challenges. We find an existing 3D file and generate a walkthough tutorial so you can recreate it yourself. All of our remixes are designed to be printed. We'll provide video and proof of the printed version.

1. To begin, open a browser and go to TinkerCAD.com
2. Login and create a new project. Name it: **Target Dummy**

3. The first piece we will create is the center post. Drag and drop a cylinder onto the stage. Set it's dimensions to:

```py
width   [x]: 5 mm
length  [y]: 5 mm

```
