# Dummy Remix Challenge

??? info "About Remix Challenges"
    Welcome the Remix Challenges. We find an existing 3D file and generate a walkthough tutorial so you can recreate it yourself. All of our remixes are designed to be printed. We'll provide video and proof of the printed version.

## **Guided Tutorial**

For this tutorial we will be making a Target Dummy using the TinkerCAD tool. We will print this a Sovol SV06 Plus 3D Printer.

1. To begin, open a browser and go to TinkerCAD.com
2. Login and create a new project. Name it: **Target Dummy**
3. The step in the project is to create the base post that the Target Dummy will spin around when the shield is hit.

    ### Base Post

4. These three parts are each created from a Cylinder.
5. Once they are each created and sized correctly, align them to the center and base of the large flat one. We'll call this the **Base Cylinder**

    ### Body No Arms

6. With the base created our next step is creating the body that will pivot around the base.

7. The body unit is made up a cylinder and three spheres.
8. To make the body we add in the cylinder, then align the sphere to make the frame.
9. We then duplicate the sphere and create tiny version and change its color. I prefer to hide this for now.
10. Once more we duplicate the sphere. However, this copy will be turned into a hole, and raised up.
11. We then group the cylinder with both visible spheres to create the body frame.
12. Next we'll unhide the small sphere we created and raise it up towards the top of the frame but not all the way up. This will make it look like the body is inside and the outside is armor.
