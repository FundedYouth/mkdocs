??? example "Remix Challenges"

    The [Remix Challenge](../../Tutorials/Remix_Challenge/) is a weekly recreation of an existing 3D object for print that we found. Once we find a model to our liking, we attempt to recreate it and 3D print it. Once the 3D print is proven we create a step-by-step tutorial on how to create it yourself. We also make sure to give full credit to the original author.
