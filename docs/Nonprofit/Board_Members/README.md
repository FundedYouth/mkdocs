## Members

!!! info "Board members on a nonprofit are considered volunteers."

    While they may receive compensation for their time and expenses, their primary role is to contribute to the organization's mission without direct financial gain. This distinction sets them apart from paid employees. Board members typically provide strategic guidance, fundraising support, and oversight of the organization's activities. Their contributions are essential to the success of the nonprofit.
