    - $140 - 200, for the Tutor LMS WordPress Plugin:Â  A professional license with once year support
    - $65 for a professional looking theme
    - $15-30/year to purchase FundedYouth.Academy (domain)

    ##### Notes:
    - Purchase Info:
    - A single site professional license with 1 year support is $200. Because we are a non-profit, we'll receive 30% off, for a total of $140. To make the site look professional we need a professional looking theme. The pro-version of the Tutor LMS does not come with their pro themes. Therefore, we will purchase a professional theme supported by Tutor LMS, listed on their site for $65. Finally, we'll need to purchase the Domain: FundedYouth.academy which will initially cost $15/year and then $30/year after the first-time purchase. We already have hosting, which is why that is not factored in.
