!!! tip "Comparing Example vs. Certficate + Membership"

    > Active and Non-Active Membership Pricing only applies to those that have completed the certifications.

    | RCL Client    | Active Member     | Non-Active    |
    |---            |---                |---            |
    | $ 404.00      | $ 2.00            | $ 4.00        |

    Looking at the example above. A client expects RCL to design the model, prepare the model for print, and print it. At the lowest possible model price of `$401.00`

    In comparison, an Active Member that's completed the course "Sovol and Cura Cert1". Would pay $40.00 one time fee to take the hands-on training and certifcation course to use the FundedYouth Sovol 3D Printers. They would now how access to the print on the Sovol machines during open lab times. With an Active Membership of $30/month they get 50% off of the hourly printing pricing model, $1.00/hour.

    If we adapt the client example model for the Active Member, the Active Member would already have a designed model and know how to prepare the model for print. They would only pay for the print time: `$2.00.`

    (Optionally) FundedYouth provides the Non-Active Member with Certificate pricing at $2.00/hour. In this example the total cost to the member would be `$4.00`.
