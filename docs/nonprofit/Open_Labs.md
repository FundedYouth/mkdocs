Title: Open Labs
---

FundedYouth has partnered with RCL to provide the public access to a maker space we call: **Open Labs**. The Open Labs provide access to 3D Printers, Laser Machines, Computers, and Certification Courses. There are two options available for accessing the Open Labs resources: Members Access or Non-Member Access.

## Members vs. Non-Members

To access the open labs for either members or non-members you are required to be certified to access each area. If you have no desire to get certified and just want to 3D print your file we offer an alternative service through RC Lasercraft (RCL)

- [RCL Alternative Pricing Models](/rcl/pricing_models.md).
