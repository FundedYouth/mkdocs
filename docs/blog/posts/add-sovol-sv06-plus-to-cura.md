I recently purchased the Sovol SV06-Plus 3D printer for a 4th-grade classroom and we ran into issues on the first few prints. After some trial and error, we realized the issue was related to the Ultimaker Cura slicing software configuration. <!-- more -->

Sovol provides a version of the Cura software but is five versions back and only for Windows users. For the rest of us, I guess the thought is that we need to figure it out. That’s a bit frustrating. Luckily after multiple trials and bad prints, I came across a post on Reddit that showed how to add the SV06-Plus profile to the latest Ultimaker Cura slicing software. So far I’ve had success. To make sure others find this information I’ve written a graphical version of the original directions. If you are tech-savvy, take a look at the original it’s quite easy.
