# Mastering HTTP Requests with Microsoft Power Automate

![](https://fundedyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HTTP-Requests-Power-Automate-Cover.png){width="500", loading-lazy}

Recently I was forced into the no-code world of Power Automate and hated it. However, while I could automate the processes on the backend using either nodejs or python it dawned on me that if I were to get sick, no one else on the team would be able to resolve the issues. This could be thought of as Job Security but personally that comes off a bit devious to me, so...<!-- more --> I took the time to learn it.

I've written a small tutorial that covers how to produce a simulated HTTP/REST style environment. Is the best solution? Far from it, but if you're like me and your company is comfortable with using then here is an option for you.

!!! note "Recently"

    After writing this article I came across the Microsoft365 REST feature. I've yet to try it out but it looks like it might be a similiar integration to the tutorial below.

## Setting Up Your First HTTP Request

n this tutorial, we’ll start by creating an HTTP request in Power Automate. Unlike traditional REST APIs where you have custom endpoints, in Power Automate, we work with POST requests and set up custom headers to manage our data. Here’s a brief overview of the process:

| Icon | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| <span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: #645FEB;">:fontawesome-solid-cloud-showers-heavy:</span> | **Create an Automated Cloud Flow**<br>Start by navigating to "My Flows" in Power Automate, then click "New Flow" and select "Automated Cloud Flow." |
| <span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: #966CE6;">:fontawesome-solid-diamond-turn-right:</span> | **Create an Define Triggers and Actions**<br>Set your trigger to "When an HTTP request is received," making the endpoint publicly accessible. Next, add an action for a response to confirm the setup. |
| <span style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: #b744cb;">:fontawesome-solid-cube:</span> | **Initialize Variables**<br>Create variables to capture custom headers like token, method type, and action type. This step is crucial for defining how your HTTP request will be processed. |

## Custom Headers and Conditional Logic

We’ll delve into initializing custom headers and variables to handle various requests:

**Custom Headers:** Define headers such as token and method type, setting up your workflow to handle different types of data requests.

**Validation:** Implement conditional logic to validate tokens and method types, ensuring only authorized requests are processed.

## Testing with Postman

Postman will be our testing ground. By sending HTTP requests with different headers, we’ll verify that our setup in Power Automate correctly processes and responds to each request type `(GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)`.


## Bringing It All Together

The real magic happens when we combine everything. By using control actions and conditions, we can simulate an API endpoint within Power Automate, making it a versatile tool for data manipulation and automation.
